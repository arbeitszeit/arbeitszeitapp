The files in this folder are SVG diagrams. 

The files can be opened and manipulated using the 
free software `draw.io <https://app.diagrams.net/>`.

After manipulating them you can "embed" the changed diagram as text into html templates.

Finally, override the `*.drawio` file in this folder with the new version.

This procedure allows us to:

- Use translations with `gettext` in diagrams.
- Make changes to existing SVG diagrams more easily.
